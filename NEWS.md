HADES 1.19.0
============

- Deprecating `Hydra` because people should no longer use it. `Strategus` is the preferred method for running full studies.
- Deprecating `ShinyAppBuilder` because it has been renamed to `OhdsiShinyAppBuilder`, but some HADES packages still need to be updated to use the new name.

Deprecation means:
- The packages are moved from the *Imports* to the *Suggests* section, and will therefore no longer automatically be installed when the `Hades` package is installed.
- On the [HADES website](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades), the packages are marked as 'Deprecated', and listed in the 'Deprecated packages' section.

HADES 1.18.0
============

- Adding OhdsiReportGenerator and OhdsiShinyAppBuilder packages. The latter will eventually replace ShinyAppBuilder when no HADES package depends on it anymore.
- Updating Characterization, which is now in CRAN.
