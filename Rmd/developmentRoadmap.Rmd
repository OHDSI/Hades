Below is a high-level overview of the development roadmap for HADES. Note that each package maintains a much more detailed list of issues.

# Short term

These tasks are in progress, and should be finished within the next two months:

- Move `Eunomia` to CRAN.

# Medium term

These task will be taken on after the short term tasks are complete. We expect to finish them within the next year:

- Add the `DataQualityDashboard` package to HADES.
- Add the `Achilles` package to HADES.  
- Add support for CDM version 6 to all packages in HADES.
- Move `FeatureExtraction` into CRAN.
- Add support for 64-bit integers throughout HADES, but starting with DatabaseConnector.

# Long term

These rasks are on our radar, but it is unclear when they will be finished.

- Add the `PheValuator` package to HADES. 
- Refactor signal injection code in `MethodEvaluation`. The code for positive control synthesis is highly complex, and there are some issues when there are many exposures with length 0. The code should be restructured, with testable units.
- Move all HADES packages to CRAN.
- Add more unit tests to all packages.
