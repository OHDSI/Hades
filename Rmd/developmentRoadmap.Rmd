Below is a high-level overview of the development roadmap for HADES. Note that each package maintains a much more detailed list of issues.

# Short term

These tasks are in progress, and should be finished within the next six months:

- Add competing risk analyses to `CohortMethod`.
- Certify support for CDM version 5.4 for all packages in HADES.
- Quarterly releases of Hydra, providing the latest and greated of HADES.


# Medium term

These task will be taken on after the short term tasks are complete. We expect to finish them within the next year:

- Add the `DataQualityDashboard` package to HADES.
- Move `FeatureExtraction` into CRAN.
- Add study package skeletons for characterization studies to `Hydra`.
- Add option to use a database backend for all Shiny apps.
- Create a study skeleton in `Hydra` for the self-controlled case series.


# Long term

These rasks are on our radar, but it is unclear when they will be finished.

- Add the `Achilles` package to HADES.  
- Add the `PheValuator` package to HADES. 
- Refactor signal injection code in `MethodEvaluation`. The code for positive control synthesis is highly complex, and there are some issues when there are many exposures with length 0. The code should be restructured, with testable units.
- Move all HADES packages to CRAN.
- Make Shiny apps more modular.
