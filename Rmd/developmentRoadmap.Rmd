Below is a high-level overview of the development roadmap for HADES. Note that each package maintains a much more detailed list of issues.

# Short term

These tasks are in progress, and should be finished within the next six months:

- Increase unit test coverage to > 80% for all packages.
- Add the `CirceR` package to HADES.  
- Add meta-analysis to the PLE skeleton in `Hydra`.
- Add competing risk analyses to `CohortMethod`.

# Medium term

These task will be taken on after the short term tasks are complete. We expect to finish them within the next year:

- Add the `DataQualityDashboard` package to HADES.
- Add the `Achilles` package to HADES.  
- Add support for CDM version 6 to all packages in HADES.
- Move `FeatureExtraction` into CRAN.
- Add study package skeletons for characterization studies to `Hydra`.
- Add option to use a database backend for all Shiny apps.

# Long term

These rasks are on our radar, but it is unclear when they will be finished.

- Add the `PheValuator` package to HADES. 
- Refactor signal injection code in `MethodEvaluation`. The code for positive control synthesis is highly complex, and there are some issues when there are many exposures with length 0. The code should be restructured, with testable units.
- Move all HADES packages to CRAN.
- Make Shiny apps more modular.
- Create a study skeleton in `Hydra` for the self-controlled case series.
