# The develop branch

All development should be done in the `develop` branch of the package GithHub repository. The aim should be to have a workable version in `develop` branch, so **make sure your package passes R CMD check locally before pushing to the `develop` branch**.

# The master branch

The head of the `master` branch should be the latest released version of the package. No changes should be directly pushed to the `master` branch.

# Continuous integration

All branches are monitored by [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart). Github Actions is a continuous integration system, meaning that any change pushed to one of the branches triggers the package to be built, and R CMD check to be performed. Any warnings or errors that occur during this process will cause an e-mail to be sent to the package maintainers. To implement continuous integration using github actions HADES package maintainers need to 

1. From [`CohortMethod`](https://github.com/OHDSI/CohortMethod/tree/develop) repo, copy `.github/workflows/R_CMD_check_Hades.yaml` and `.github/workflows/nightly_cleanup_Hades.yaml` into the `.github/workflows` subdirectory in the new repository.
2. Add a build status badge to `README.md`: `[![Build Status](https://github.com/OHDSI/<reponame>/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OHDSI/<reponame>/actions?query=workflow%3AR-CMD-check)`
3. `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` the new files.
4. Ensure that github Actions are now executing by visiting: https://github.com/OHDSI/<reponame>/actions 
 

# Version numbering

Each package has a three-digit version number.

- New micro versions (e.g. from 4.3.2 to 4.3.3) indicate bug fixes only. No new functionality, and forward and backward compatibility are guaranteed

- New minor versions (e.g. from 4.3.3 to 4.4.0) indicate added functionality. Only backward compatibility is guaranteed

- New major versions (e.g. from 4.4.0 to 5.0.0) indicate major revisions. All bets are off in terms of compatibility

# Creating a release

Only the package maintainer may create a new release. The release should be prepared in the `develop` branch. The following steps are mandatory:

1. Update the package version number in the DESCRIPTION file.

2. Update the documentation. This includes the following steps. Note that the `extras/PackageMaintenance.R` file should contain the code needed to perform most of these steps:

	- Run roxygen to regenerate the manual files.
	- Updating the `NEWS.md` file to reflect all the changes and bugfixes included in the new version.
	- Perform a spellcheck using `devtools::spellcheck()`
	- Regenerate the package manual PDF.
	- Regenerate any vignette PDFs. 
	- Regerate the package website using `pkgdown`.


3. Make sure the package passes R check, both locally and on Github Actions.

For those packages that go into CRAN, the following additional step must be taken:

4. Check the package using `devtools::check_win_devel()` and `devtools::check_rhub()`.


Once all these steps are completed and commited to the `develop` branch, the package can be released by merging `develop` into `master`. 

Pushing changes to the `master` branch where the version number in the DESCRIPTION file is higher than the current one will trigger the automated release process. If the package passes R check, the following steps are automatically performed:

1. A new tag is created in the GitHub repo with the version number.

2. The package is pushed to the [OHDSI `drat` repo](https://github.com/OHDSI/drat).

For those packages that go into CRAN, the package can be submitted to CRAN using `devtools::release()`.
