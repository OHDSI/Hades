The table below lists, for each package, which database testing servers it uses as part of its unit tests.

- T means the package uses the database server for testing
- X means the package does **not** use the database server for testing
- An empty cell means the package does not directly talk to the database

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
data <- readRDS("../extras/DatabaseTestServerUsage.rds")
data <- data[order(data$package), ]
dbmss <- colnames(data)
dbmss <- dbmss[dbmss != "package"]

lines <- c(
  "<div id=slanttable>",
  "<table>",
  "  <thead>",
  "    <tr>",
  "      <th>Package</th>",
  sprintf("      <th><div><span>%s</span></div></th>", dbmss),
  "    </tr>",
  "  </thead>",
  "  <tbody>",
   sapply(seq_len(nrow(data)), function(i) c("    <tr>",
                                            sprintf("      <td>%s</td>", data$package[i]),
                                            sprintf("      <td%s>%s</td>", 
                                                    ifelse(is.na(data[i, dbmss]), "", ifelse(data[i, dbmss], " style=\"background:#cdf5bf;\"", " style=\"background:#f5c3bf;\"")),
                                                    ifelse(is.na(data[i, dbmss]), "&nbsp;", ifelse(data[i, dbmss], "T", "X"))
                                                    ),
                                            "    </tr>")),
  "  </tbody>",
  "</table>",
  "</div>"
)

This table was constructed simply by looking for the environmental variable names of the test server credentials in each package's test code, and may therefore not reflect actual testing. Whether a package connects to a database at all was determined by evaluating whether it imports DatabaseConnector.
