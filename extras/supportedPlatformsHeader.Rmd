Below are the database platforms currently supported by HADES, with the following details:

- **Platform**: The name of the platform.
- **Abbreviation**: the abbreviation used throughout HADES.
- **Status**: The status of HADES support. 'Deprecated' means code for that platform exists, but the OHDSI community no longer supports it, so no guarantees are given. 
- **Testing**: Whether the platform is tested in HADES' continuous integration.
