# Evaluation

The population-level estimation methods have been extensively evaluated using the OHDSI Methods Benchmark. The results are published in:

- Schuemie MJ, Cepeda MS, Suchard MA, et al. [How Confident Are We About Observational Findings in Health Care: A Benchmark Study](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/fxz7kr65) Harvard Data Science Review, 2(1).

The results of the evaluation can be reviewed in [an interactive web application](https://data.ohdsi.org/MethodEvalViewer/).
